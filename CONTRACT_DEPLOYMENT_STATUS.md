## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **Compilation** ✅ **SUCCESSFUL**
```bash
Compiled 16 Solidity files successfully (evm target: paris).
```

### **Test Results**
- ✅ Contract deployment: **PASSED**
- ✅ Owner setup: **PASSED**
- ✅ Username validation: **PASSED**
- ✅ System statistics: **PASSED**
- ✅ Pause functionality: **PASSED**
- ⚠️ User registration: **NEEDS FIXING**
- ⚠️ File operations: **NEEDS FIXING**

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps for Production Deployment**

### **1. Deploy to 0G Storage Testnet**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network testnet
```

### **2. Update Agent Configuration**
Update `packages/agent/configs/config.yaml` with deployed contract addresses:
```yaml
contracts:
  nebula_vault_address: "0x..." # From deployment
  file_storage_address: "0x..." # From deployment
  access_control_address: "0x..." # From deployment
  proof_verification_address: "0x..." # From deployment
```

### **3. Integrate with Agent**
- Replace simulated 0G Storage operations with real contract calls
- Implement blockchain transaction handling
- Add contract event monitoring

### **4. Verify Contracts**
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network testnet <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

---

## 🔐 **Security Features**

### **Access Control**
- ✅ Owner controls for critical functions
- ✅ Role-based permissions
- ✅ User authorization for files
- ✅ Emergency pause functionality

### **Economic Security**
- ✅ Storage fees prevent spam
- ✅ Verification rewards
- ✅ Reputation system
- ✅ Slashing mechanisms

---

## 📈 **Monitoring**

### **Key Events to Monitor**
```solidity
event FileUploaded(bytes32 indexed fileHash, address indexed uploader, ...);
event FileDownloaded(bytes32 indexed fileHash, address indexed downloader, ...);
event ProofVerified(bytes32 indexed fileHash, address indexed verifier, ...);
event UserRegistered(address indexed user, string username, ...);
```
